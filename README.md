# Games Recommender System
Steam is an online platform which allows users to purchase games to play. Steam would presumably profit from each game purchase by taking a cut from the sale. When gamers procure in-game items, Steam would also likely take a share of the sale.

Assuming the above business model to be true, it would be in Steam's interest to recommend games to users to purchase and to also recommend games that users would spend a long time playing to increase the likelihood of them purchasing in-game items to elevate their gaming experience.

As such, a games recommender system is developed with a dataset of games purchased and cumulative play time of various users obtained from Steam. In this project, a hybrid games recommender system would be developed using a number of possible recommender algorithms to deploy a three-pronged approach so as to increase the likelihood of a user finding a game he/she would like to purchase and play. These include:

Top Seller Recommender (based on top purchases)
Community Recommender (based on top play times)
Neural Collaborative Filtering Recommender (using Deep Neural Network and based on user-game interactions)
